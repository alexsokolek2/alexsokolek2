Hi, I'm Alex Sokolek. I'm a retired Electronics/Computer engineer, with 45 years of experience.  I'm currently
acting as a hobbiest, writing Windows applications using Visual Studio 2022. I'm interested inm sharing my
knowledge with the community and in seeing what is out there that I can learn from.

My experience ranges from Windows API using C++, to systems design and networking. I spent time in a nuclear
power stations as the Radiation Monitoring Specialist, supporting a network of microprocessor based monitors and
the mini computers running them.

I'm also a retired Liturgical Musician, having been an organist and choir director.
