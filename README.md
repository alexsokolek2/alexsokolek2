Hi, I'm Alex Sokolek. I'm a retired Electronics/Computer engineer, with 45 years of experience.  I'm currently
acting as a hobbiest, writing Windows applications using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. I'm interested
in sharing my knowledge with the community and in seeing what is out there that I can learn from.

My experience ranges from Windows API using C++, to systems design and networking. I spent time in a nuclear
power station as the Radiation Monitoring Specialist, supporting a network of microprocessor based monitors and
the mini computers running them. I also spent time in a public utility supporting a network of hand-held computers.

I'm working on a Mendelbrot Set program, a Find and Mark Duplicate Files program, and a Keyboard/Mouse Message
Monitor program. I hope to have these ppublished in the next few days.

I'm also a retired Liturgical Musician, having been an organist and choir director.
