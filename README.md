I am a retired computer/electronics engineer with 45 some odd years of experience. My background includes programming, engineering, and systems design. I spent time in a nuclear power plant as the Radiation Monitoring Systems Specialist, supporting a network of microprocessor based radiation monitors and the mini computers running them. Then I was with a public utility supporting natural gas operations, and then, in IT, a network of field-based hand-held computers.

I dabble in Visual Studio to write Windows programs. I would like to join some groups where I can share my programs with my peers and get ideas for new programs.

I am also a retired liturgical musician, having been an organist and choir director.
